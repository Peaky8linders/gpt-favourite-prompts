# Prompts and templates used for interacting with LLMs.

This is a collection of prompts based on Mckay Wrigley's git repo, and prompt templates that I use in my day to day work and side projects.


## Usage

Download the json file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/142KoReNVMeoqcaZ3Njj9ltnadnEXAmCo/view?usp=sharing) and import it into [Chatbot UI](https://www.chatbotui.com/).

Or, you can just copy and paste the prompts you want into ChatGPT.
